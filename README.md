# twitter_chatbot
### This twitter chatbot is based on n-gram model of natural language processing
I have written the code for generating each unigram and bigrams and then smoothing is used to increase the performance

I have used the perplexity and entropy measures to evaluate our model

It will generate a tweet based on the key-word provided and performs well
